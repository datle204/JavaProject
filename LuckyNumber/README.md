This game will have the following basic functions:

The system will automatically generate a random number between 0 and maximum (which is a predefined constant). For example: maximum is 100 then the lucky number will be a random natural number between 0 and 100.

Then the player will be entered any number that they think coincides with the lucky number - lucky number.

If the user enters a higher number than the lucky number, the program will display: the lucky number is smaller than your prediction.

If the user enters a lower number than the lucky number, the program will display: the lucky number is greater than your prediction.

If the user enters the correct number as the lucky number, the program will display: congrats you have guessed the lucky number correctly after x guesses. Where, x is the number of times the user has predicted this turn.

The following advanced functions:

After each play, the system will automatically ask the player: do you want to continue playing? If the user chooses one of the following answers: “y”, “Y”, “yes”, “YES”, “Yes”. Note: not case sensitive in the answer “yes”. In addition to the above answers, for example "NO", "N", "no", "co", all are considered as the game is stopped.

After the player stops playing, the system prints the overall result of the game. Information includes: total number of plays, total number of predictions, average number of predictions per turn and best game (the game with the least number of predictions).
