This game will have the following basic functions:

+ The system will automatically generate a random number between 0 and maximum (which is a predefined constant). For example: maximum is 100 then the lucky number will be a random natural number between 0 and 100.

+ Then the player will be entered any number that they think coincides with the lucky number - lucky number.

+ If the user enters a higher number than the lucky number, the program will display: the lucky number is smaller than your prediction.
+ If the user enters a lower number than the lucky number, the program will display: the lucky number is greater than your prediction.
+ If the user enters the correct number as the lucky number, the program will display: congrats you have guessed the lucky number correctly after x guesses. Where, x is the number of times the user has predicted this turn.

The following advanced functions:

+ After each play, the system will automatically ask the player: do you want to continue playing? If the user chooses one of the following answers: “y”, “Y”, “yes”, “YES”, “Yes”. Note: not case sensitive in the answer “yes”. In addition to the above answers, for example "NO", "N", "no", "co", all are considered as the game is stopped.

+ After the player stops playing, the system prints the overall result of the game. Information includes: total number of plays, total number of predictions, average number of predictions per turn and best game (the game with the least number of predictions).
